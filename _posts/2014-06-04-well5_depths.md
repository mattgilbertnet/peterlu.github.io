# Compositing images to get a higher-magnification view of the entire sample

The 2.5x images are good to show the entire sample, but the resolution is limited. To get a higher-resolution view of the sample, we switch to a higher-magnification objective lens; however, the tradeoff is that the field of view is curtailed, and only part of the sample fits into the visible field of view. Fortunately, the LMM has an automated stage, so that the position of the sample visible to the microscope can be controlled remotely. As a result, we can take images in a tile-pattern that cover the entire sample:

The different fluorescence images are the tiled composite image taken at different depths from the cover slip inside the sample. Each "tile" is a bit darker to the left, so that the rectangles representing each individual 10x image are easily seen. This is a result of uneven illumination; the samples are illuminated by light from a lamp, which does not cover the sample evenly (which might be ameliorated by changing internal microscope aperture settings).

But we have another way we might correct for this problem: a couple of our samples are fluorescent dye dispersed in a solvent inside identical sample wells---physically, the intensity of fluorescence should be completely even / isotropic, so any unevenness in the image should be caused by the illumination. By taking images under identical conditions of both the phase-separating sample of interest, and of the even dye solution, we should be able to cancel the background and see the sample without the effects of the uneven lamp illumination. So we will be testing this in upcoming operations.

Meanwhile, next stage is to look at higher-magnification, where we seek to understand the details of small portions of the sample, and see the behavior of these colloid structures up close.
