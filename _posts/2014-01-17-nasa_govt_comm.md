title: NASA, government's role, and changing science communication

# NASA's critics miss the point, but it still needs to change

If there is any question of my editorial independence, this essay ought to banish that notion! To understand why I think it is so important that we as scientists spread an accurate message of what we actually are doing, we have to consider the broader themes of what NASA's role is, how it fits into and represents an overwhelmingly large Federal Government bureaucracy that is largely untrusted by the public today, and how its communication to the public at large and its Congressional masters tends to leave just about everyone unsatisfied. I happen to believe that NASA needs to adapt to this new environment, specifically how it communicates its scientific work---a major motivation for me to speak out here. But NASA still does work that no other organization in the world is capable of doing, and represents perhaps the most visible and important role that the United States plays in advancing the role of science in the minds of people all around the world. It's complicated, and political, and economic---and I expect to have some pushback, so have at it in the comments, and let me know if anything I have said is factually incorrect. But to understand where we are today, we have to back to the beginning.

## NASA in the glory days of Big Government

And the political environment of the 1960s supported the notion that large programs driven by an activist government could make the world a better place, particularly in the United States. Coming out of the Great Depression and the second World War, America and its citizens had experienced tremendous hardship, but emerged victorious and started rebuilding the country, and the world, through the 1950s. In the 1960s, activist government policies made tremendous changes, and [Great Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Society) programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, and the National Endowment for the Humanities offered the promise of a basic standard of a secure, safe, cultured life for everyone. Civil Rights legislation turned back centuries of discrimination, and was imposed by the Federal government over recalcitrant states. The Clean Air act established the government as the final arbiter over the environment. 

It was in this context that NASA came into its own as a worldwide force for the advancement on mankind during the days of Apollo, when we beat the Soviets to land a man on the moon. This was a major historical achievment, arguably the most important in the second half of the 20th century. But while we tend to focus on the sheer awesomeness of the technical aspects, less thought is usually given as to how it was largely a political project. Landing a man on the moon was identified as the top scientific and technical priority by President John F. Kennedy, as opposed to a committee of scientists. And, as a result, NASA was given resources that could be dreamed of, outside the context of a war; at its height, NASA received almost [4.5% of the federal budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA). In today's terms, held at a constant percentage, with a [$3.45 trillion budget in 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget), NASA would have received $152 billion.

With those resources, and concomitant pressure from the highest levels of government---the President of the United States, not least---NASA was able to equip the smartest people with the tools they needed to accomplish historically-great feats. The goal was well-defined, and its perception of impossibility could attract the best and brightest, in addition to the essential guarantee of sufficient resources. 

Moreover, its technical achievements were coming in an era when developments in technology were changing the way in which people lived and worked, in very obvious and meaningful ways. Integrated circuits, the basis of all modern electronic chips, were invented in the late 1950s, jet propulsion was shrinking the world and allowing businesses to spread their reach globally. Even the [microwave oven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven), developed from WWII radar technology, first came into American homes in the late 1960s.

The paradigm for science was very clear: the federal government would dump an enormous amount of money into one of their organizations, NASA, which could hire the best and the brightest and not worry about funding. These guys (and they were overwhelmingly male, and whitee, but no one seemed to worry about that at the time) would accomplish great things, do what was thought not to be possible, and along the way develop spinoff technologies that would improve the lives of ordinary people in significant, obvious, beneficial ways. So, of course it made sense to support, and revere, NASA: they beat the Soviets in the space race, and made all of our lives better! And all NASA had to do to keep the public, and therefore its representatives in Congress, happy, was to achieve something awesome and talk about all the benefits that were showered down upon everyone else. 

Alas, this social contract of sorts pretty much worked until the moon landings became routine, and then things started to unravel...

## Today's reality: political and economic decline

![NASA budget](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/NASA-budget-federal.jpg){: .imagealignright} Unfortunately, the landscape today is far cry from the heyday of the 1960s. From a funding perspective, NASA receives merely a tenth of what it did 50 years earlier, relative to the total federal budget: less than half a percent. In fact, this year's budget is the lowest ever, except for the first two years of NASA's existence when it was ramping up from nothing---and falling. In a way, the public and Congress still expects great things from NASA, but at the same time they also cut its funding by a factor of 10. 

Moreover, the idea that big government programs work for the good of society, or at even worth paying for, has become exceedingly controversial. The War on Poverty has failed to change significantly the fraction of the population at the poverty line (though the absolute quality of life at that line has vastly improved), and if anything, economic inequality has increased (though whether this is a good or bad thing depends on one's philosophical predilections). Medicare and Social Security are headed toward insolvency in the absence of reform. And the largest government healthcare program, Obamacare, is perceived by a large majority of the public to need either serious structural reform, or simply be scrapped. The idea that the government can do anything significant on its own, aside from the military, is not held by anything close to a majority of Americans, particularly among the youngest groups surveyed---pointing to a likely future decline in perception of the government's value and effectiveness, which is hard to believe when Congress is popular only among about a tenth of the population.

Furthermore, political polarization has increased tremendously. Republicans are often blamed for being "anti-science," and even NASA was dragged into this during climate debates of the George W. Bush administration, accused by global-warming advocates of suppressing data, though this turned out not to be the case. Barack Obama came into office promising to "restore science to its proper place," yet has presided over continual decline in NASA's budgets---which were not increased significantly when Democrats held both houses of Congress in 2008-2010. Under Obama, America stopped flying the Space Shuttle, leaving no other option to transport Americans to the Space Station than via Russia; in response to recent sanctions against Russia for annexing the Crimean peninsula, Vladimir Putin threatened to cutoff such access (though in the distant future, suggesting that, per usual, this was political rhetoric). 

Though tossed around like a political football, NASA's structure as a large federal bureaucracy does not help, as it is governed by myriad rules often designed for a 

## Non-partisan arguments for fundamental research

The Democrats pay lip service to funding science, but when it comes down to passing a budget, during the Obama administration they certainly did nothing to increase NASA funding to any level it reached under George W. Bush. Now, like all government departments, NASA may be under philosophical threat from conservative Republicans who want to pare back the Federal Government in general, though most Republican budgets propose small increases.
What is very clear is that no one is proposing to give NASA any significant funding increase of more than a few percent, let alone the 10x that would get it back to its funding levels in the golden era of the 1960s.

But there is a very good argument that should appeal to both sides of the aisle as to why NASA, and fundamental science research, should be funded by the government:

### Scientific and technical developments are the *only* thing that ultimately lead to real economic growth

In general, economists agree that significant economic growth only comes from new technologies. Perhaps the most recent example is the internet, and the economic growth it has allowed, centered in the US. Qualitatively new technologies come as a result of fundamental scientific research, in a whole host of fields. The trillions of dollars that internet-based companies have created in new wealth in the USA could only have occurred after decades of improvements in electronics, materials, mathematical algorithms, optics, etc. etc. The countries that have not been able to take advantage of this, e.g. sub-saharan Africa, remain comparatively poor.

### Government-sponsored research is the sensible mechanism when the payback horizon is more than several years

If the federal government operates on a two-year election cycle, companies today are driven by quarterly earnings. Fundamental research, that may pay back only many years in the future, is therefore largely unsustainable in the corporate environment. Most of the great industrial labs devoted to fundamental research---notably Bell Labs at AT&T, IBM and Exxon---abandoned most fundamental research decades ago, focusing much more on product development applications.

So why should the government fund this research into fundamental science and technology that might not materialize for decades? Simply because, whenever these developments lead to economic growth, the US treasury benefits directly from the windfall by capturing the tax revenues. The internet economy has led to billions and billions of dollars in new tax revenue (offshore accounting tricks by the largest companies notwithstanding), orders of magnitude more than the original investment by the Defense Department in ARPAnet, the predecessor of the modern internet.

Even if one believes in cutting unnecessary government spending, fundamental research is an investment in the future that actually improves the long-term fiscal picture. The problem is that it is not predictable: one particular, specific program can not with any accuracy be predicted to lead to a certain amount of economic growth. And therein lies the problem, for politicians that believe that they can control the future via policy. NASA, the NSF, and the NIH doing fundamental scientific research will create jobs, wealth and a better tomorrow, but not in a way that we can predict today.
