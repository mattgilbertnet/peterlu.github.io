title: First images of ACE-M2 sample
---

# First images from the Light Microscopy Module (LMM)

We have 15 samples in the holder in this set of experiments, and our first task is to image all of the samples with the lowest-magnification microscope objective lens (2.5x). This lens's magnification is ideal for the task, as it gives an image of each entire sample well. We first use brightfield transmission illumination (50/50 filter), where the intensity of the image is proportional to the amount of light passing through different parts of the sample. Thus, magnetic stir bar appears dark, as it transmits no light, and the glass appears bright, as most of the light passes through. Bubbles act as mini-lenses, and therefore are bright in the center and dark around their edges; the light from the edges is bent toward the center (or focused) by the bubble. These features are evident in an image of well number 5, containing a phase-separating sample, as shown in the image on the left.

The image on the right is the same sample and position, but collected in fluorescence mode, where the intensity is proportional to the number of (fluorescent particles). Interestingly, we observe higher concentrations of particles aggregating around the edges of the sample chamber, the stir bar and the bubbles. Neither the stir bar nor bubble contain any fluorescent particles, and like the background glass appear black.
